<br/>Check out my new hotel management app made with React query, Supabase, and CSS-styled components.
This app is only built for the sole purpose of being used inside a hotel for management, with almost zero client interaction.
If you want a client-side version where users can make accounts. log in by themselves and book cabins dynamically, please let me know, and I will work on that too. 
Any feedback is appreciated.
Currently, all delete operation is restricted due to security reasons. But you can check the app, login credentials have already been provided in the login form. Today's activity might have no data because It depends on the booking data. Especially, who is going to arrive today and which guests are gonna leave. If you really want to see the Today Activity chart feel free to message me.

Features:
* Dashboard with Pie and Grid chart with real-time data.
* User authentication and image upload using Supabase.
* Adding new cabins and editing existing ones.

More features coming soon such as creating a booking upon arrival, adding guest accounts, and many more.
